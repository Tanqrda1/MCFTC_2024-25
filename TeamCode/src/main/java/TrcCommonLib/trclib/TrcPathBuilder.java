/**
 * This class builds a TrcPath for path following drive. The path can be built from two types of waypoints:
 * INCREMENTAL_PATH - points in the path are relative to their previous points.
 * REFERENCE_FRAME_PATH - points in the path are in the same reference frame as the starting pose.
 * <p>
 * For example, in traditional PID drive:
 * If the robot starts at the absolute field position of (x=48.0, y=12.0, heading=0.0) and we would want to
 * specify a path with 3 segments of relative movement:
 * 1. move forward 24 inches.
 * 2. turn left 90 degrees.
 * 3. strafe right 36 inches.
 * At the end, the robot will be at (x=48.0, y=72.0, heading=-90.0).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In INCREMENTAL_PATH mode, we would do:
 * TrcPathBuilder pathBuilder = new TrcPathBuilder(driveBase.getFieldPosition(), true)
 *                                  .append(new TrcPose2D(0.0, 24.0, -90.0))
 *                                  .append(new TrcPose2D(36.0, 0.0, 0.0));
 * </p>
 * In REFERENCE_FRAME_PATH mode, we would do:
 * TrcPathBuilder pathBuilder = new TrcPathBuilder(driveBase.getFieldPosition(), false)
 *                                  .append(driveBase.getFieldPosition())
 *                                  .append(new TrcPose2D(48.0, 36.0, -90.0))
 *                                  .append(new TrcPose2D(48.0, 72.0, -90.0));
