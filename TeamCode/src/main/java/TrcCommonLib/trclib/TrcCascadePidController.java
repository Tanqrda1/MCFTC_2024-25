/**
 * This class implements a Cascade PID Controller. A Cascade PID controller consists of two PID controllers in cascade.
 * The output of the primary PID controller feeds into the input of the secondary PID controller. If the motor is not
 * linear, it may be very difficult to get good performance out of a single PID controller. In Cascade PID control,
 * the distance set-point, for example, will produce a speed control as the primary output and feeds into the
 * secondary PID controller as input that will try to compensate for the non-linearity of the motor or even battery
 * level changes. The TrcCascadePidController class extends a regular PID control as its primary PID controller and
 * creates a second PID controller as its secondary controller.
