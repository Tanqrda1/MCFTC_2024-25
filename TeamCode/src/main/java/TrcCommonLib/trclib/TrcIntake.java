/**
 * This class implements a platform independent auto-assist intake subsystem. It contains a motor or a continuous
 * servo and a sensor that detects if the intake has captured objects. It provides the autoAssist method that allows
 * the caller to call the intake subsystem to pickup or dump objects on a press of a button and the intake subsystem
 * will stop itself once it is done. While it provides the auto-assist functionality to pickup or dump objects, it
 * also supports exclusive subsystem access by implementing TrcExclusiveSubsystem. This enables the intake subsystem
 * to be aware of multiple callers' access to the subsystem. While one caller starts the intake for an operation,
 * nobody can access it until the previous caller is done with the operation.
